# Homework 5: OpenWeather API Analysis
---
### Demonstrating the ability to use API calls & basic linear regression models.
In this assignment, I managed to successfully do API calls for 500+ random cities and various weather information.
I took this information and output it to a dataframe and saved it to a CSV file.

Afterwards, I used matplotlib to plot a few different scatter plots to display information, comparing certain latitudes to various different weather conditions, such as wind speed, cloudiness, humidity, etc.

I then developed a few different linear regression models with these plots, showing predictions on how certain weather conditions might look as you get further or closer to the equator.
